# *Week One Challenge: Horiseon mock site*

*This is a mock site that I was asked to refactor for efficiency and accessibility.* 



## Setup 
The only setup required should be that one must click the URL to be taken to the site. 


### Getting started

The site may be distorted if not viewing in a full window. 

## Usage

The site has a navigation bar on the top right that links to three different sections within the page. There is also aside bar to the right of the main content with further information regarding the site's company. 

## Team

* Myself, the EdX and U of U Bootcamp provided the starter code.

## Errors and bugs

There are no bugs that I have found or noticed, however, I do think the CSS code could possibly be consolidated a bit more, but I couldn't do it without breaking the site. The large background image was included through CSS and I was not able to include an "alt" attribute, so I used a WAI-ARIA attribute which is something I learned about in my coding game. I hope that it OK!
